**Explanation:**
It seems as though, after tuning, sufficient mobility can be obtained through the first few obstacles. However, the vehicle is unable to recover from the oval-shaped obstacle. This is most likely due to the heading angle after coming out of the avoidance of this obstacle. The vehicle is facing the corner for a few time-steps, which makes recovery to the correct opening too difficult given constraints on the turning angle.
